### **The Problem**

The problem for the user is the amount of research that needs to be done to find the right investment and the high fees buying the Bitcoin DeFi tokens. This can also mean that the portfolio is unbalanced where he may have all his eggs in one basket increasing risk. And holding some tokens for a long time will have some that are dragging down his portfolio.

### **The Solution**

The solution that BIT10 offers is it will have a pre-picked basket of assets that the user can hold simply buying one token. This would reduce the costs and time spent researching, you'll invest in a range of different assets to diversify, and an auto-rebalancing mechanism to replace bad performing tokens with good ones.
