title: Installing and Setting Up Plug Wallet
---

We are using the Plug wallet as our primary wallet for the testnet. You can install the Plug wallet extension in your browser by visiting [plugwallet.ooo](https://plugwallet.ooo). Support for other wallets, such as Xverse and Unisat, will be available soon.

### Why Plug wallet?

We are currently using the Plug wallet for the testnet because it simplifies connecting dApps on the Internet Computer and managing token transactions. Our token and infrastructure are built on the Internet Computer. Learn more about How it works.

### Setting Up Plug Wallet

After installing the Plug wallet extension, open it. Here are some key terms:

1. **Principal ID**: This is your unique wallet identifier generated for each wallet.
2. **Account ID**: This is derived from the Principal ID and is used in the ICP and NFT registries to identify the owners of ICP and NFTs.
3. **Manage**: Click this button to select the tokens you want to display in your wallet.
