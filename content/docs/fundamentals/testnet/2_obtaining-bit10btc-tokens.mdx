### **What is BIT10.BTC token?**

BIT10.BTC is a test token with the same value as testnet BTC. We use BIT10.BTC instead of testnet BTC tokens for the following reasons:

1. **Transaction Costs**: Requesting testnet BTC from a testnet BTC faucet results in receiving approximately 0.00011421 BTC or 7.68 USD. The average transaction cost on Bitcoin is between $16 - $20, meaning users need more test tokens and face high transaction fees. BIT10.BTC has lower transaction fees and faster transaction speeds.
2. **User Insights**: Using BIT10.BTC allows us to identify users on our platform and reach out for feedback, helping us improve our services.
