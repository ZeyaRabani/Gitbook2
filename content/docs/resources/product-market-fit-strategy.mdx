Index funds in traditional finance have been around decades and now control over $15 Trillion.

We anticipate that a lot of liquidity will come into the Crypto markets in the years to come and mostly in the Bitcoin Ecosystem. With the rise of Bitcoin Layers/sidechains allowing DApps to be built on Bitcoin, these projects will over time do significantly better than there EVM counterpart DApps.

The issue arrises in the way that new investors buy or trade these assets as they are complicated to buy and use. In the Ethereum Ecosystem, there is a project called INDEX COOP who are making Index funds with Ethe related crypto's and protocols built on the EVM. They have $123 in TVL and they generated around $1 million in revenue in 2023 during a bear market. As Bitcoin DeFi grows BIT10 will become the leader in this space and outgrow INDEX COOP in the years to come
