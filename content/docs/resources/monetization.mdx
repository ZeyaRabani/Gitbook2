The transaction fee model is a fundamental monetization strategy for BIT10.

This model involves charging users a fee for each transaction processed through the network.

Here's how the transaction fee model could work for BIT10:

1. **Fee Per Transaction**: Users could be charged a small fee for every transaction executed on the BIT10 DApp. As highlighted with the Business model image above.
2. **Management fee:** This could be charged on a regular basis like Quarterly. The reason behind it will be the rebalancing of the token and the audits.

The transaction fee model provides a direct, usage-based revenue stream for BIT10. By carefully balancing fee levels to ensure competitiveness and affordability, BIT10 will attract wide variety of users as well as ensuring the network's financial health and  development.
