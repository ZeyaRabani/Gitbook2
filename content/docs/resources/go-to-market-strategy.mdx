title: Go To Market Strategy
---

The go-to-market strategy for BIT10 revolves around two core principles:

1. **New users**:
   * From our numerous interviews with Angel users we've determined that users who have invested into traditional index funds and also on-chain Index funds like INDEX COOP are new users. This is because they're reluctant/don't know how to invest into Bitcoin DeFi as it's a long complicated process plus the high gas fees for the Bitcoin Network wouldn't make sense.\
     We address this problem with our BIT10 token as we make it extremely easy to buy the token and then allow the user to expose themselves to Bitcoin DeFi. This arbitrage of Ethereum investors transitioning into Bitcoin investors will increase as time goes on with the numerous DApps being developed and building on Bitcoin Layer 2's and sidechains.
2. **Long terms investors**:
   * The majority of transactions in the Crypto industry are made by two groups, the first is Bots and the second are Degen traders. We understand that our angel users will be users who trade once or twice a month buying and holding the BIT10 token, exactly like traditional finance where you would periodically buy an Index whether it's weekly, monthly etc.\
     We aim to cater to these long term investors as they won't be checking charts everyday but relying a consistent growth year over year but by allowing Bitcoin DeFi to enter their investment portfolio, there is still that net-safe demeanour as they will be buying an Index Fund as oppose to one single currency or Bitcoin itself.

Together, these strategies aim to position BIT10 as the premier Index Fund provider on Bitcoin's DeFi, leveraging liquidity and growing ecosystem, while also ensuring decentralization through building on Bitcoin.
