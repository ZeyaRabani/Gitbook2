We plan to build several index tokens to represent different categories of asset on the Bitcoin chain.

1. The first one is the most important and the one we are focusing currently: BIT10.DEFI. This token will represent a basket of assets that are linked to the Decentralized Finance on Bitcoin. It involves Layer 2 tokens, Dapps, and Infrastructure protocols.
2. The second one is about ordinals. We aim to create a token that gathers the blue chips ordinals on the Bitcoin chain in one token. That means we have to make those NFTs liquid through fragmentation to simplify the way to invest as they have a major barrier to entry: high price and liquidity.
3. Finally the 3rd token we aim to build is about BRC20's assets. BRC20 means we want to look at the projects that are built on the Bitcoin's Layer 1.
4. With the release of Runes, this will also be something we look to have an Index Fund of as we anticipate solid projects will be built on Runes.
